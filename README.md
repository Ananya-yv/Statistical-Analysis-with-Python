# Statistical Analysis with Python
This repository contains a python notebook showing basic tutorial on conducting statistical analysis using python.
<br>
<br>
It explores both descriptive and inferential statistics. Appropriate visualizations were also included for the linear regressions.   
A Diabetes data set is used to perform the analysis. 
<br>
### Tools Used:
**Pandas:** Helped load and manage the dataset, allowing easy calculation of descriptive statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation.
<br>
**SciPy/Statsmodels:** Performed hypothesis testing and calculated confidence intervals.
<br>
**Statsmodels/Scikit-learn:** Conducted linear regression analysis to explore relationships between variables, generating key statistics like coefficients and p-values.
<br>
**Matplotlib/Seaborn:** Created visualizations to display the relationships between variables and illustrate the regression line.
